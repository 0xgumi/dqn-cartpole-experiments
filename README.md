# 🧠 DQN CartPole Experiments

This repository contains Deep Q-Network (DQN) experiments on the CartPole-v1 environment using PyTorch.  
It is structured to support multiple experimental versions (e.g., v1, v2, ...), with organized results and summaries.

---

## 📁 Project Structure

- `v1_basic_dqn/` – Basic DQN implementation (Version 1)  
  Contains training and evaluation code

- `results/` – Organized experiment results (CSV + TXT)  
  Results are grouped into subfolders per version (e.g., `v1/`, `v2/`...)

---

## 🔧 Requirements

- Python 3.10+
- `torch`
- `gymnasium`
- `numpy`
- `pandas`

---

## 🚀 Future Plans

- Implement and compare Double DQN  
- Explore Dueling DQN architecture  
- Add Prioritized Experience Replay (PER)  
- Evaluate and visualize performance across multiple versions
